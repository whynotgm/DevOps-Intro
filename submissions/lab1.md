# Lab 1 Submission

## Task 1: SSH Commit Signing and QuickNotes Run

### QuickNotes Evidence

QuickNotes was run locally with a temporary data file:

```bash
ADDR=:18080 DATA_PATH=/tmp/quicknotes-lab1-notes.json SEED_PATH=seed.json go run .
```

Server startup output:

```text
2026/06/07 15:18:52 quicknotes listening on :18080 (notes loaded: 4)
```

Health check before creating a note:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:18080/health | python3 -m json.tool
```

```json
{
    "notes": 4,
    "status": "ok"
}
```

List notes before creating a note:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:18080/notes | python3 -m json.tool
```

```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "Welcome to QuickNotes",
        "body": "This is the project you'll containerize, deploy, monitor, and harden across all 10 labs.",
        "created_at": "2026-01-15T10:00:00Z"
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "title": "Read app/main.go first",
        "body": "Start by understanding the entry point \u2014 env vars, signal handling, graceful shutdown.",
        "created_at": "2026-01-15T10:05:00Z"
    },
    {
        "id": 3,
        "title": "DevOps mantra",
        "body": "If it hurts, do it more often.",
        "created_at": "2026-01-15T10:10:00Z"
    },
    {
        "id": 4,
        "title": "Endpoint cheat-sheet",
        "body": "GET /notes  GET /notes/{id}  POST /notes  DELETE /notes/{id}  GET /health  GET /metrics",
        "created_at": "2026-01-15T10:15:00Z"
    }
]
```

Create a new note:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:18080/notes \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"title":"hello","body":"first POST"}' | python3 -m json.tool
```

```json
{
    "id": 5,
    "title": "hello",
    "body": "first POST",
    "created_at": "2026-06-07T12:19:25.436341Z"
}
```

Health check after creating a note:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:18080/health | python3 -m json.tool
```

```json
{
    "notes": 5,
    "status": "ok"
}
```

### SSH Signing Evidence

Git signing configuration:

```text
gpg.format=ssh
user.signingkey=~/.ssh/inno-devops-signing.pub
commit.gpgsign=true
```

Signed commit verification:

```text
TODO: replaced after the first signed submission commit is created.
```

Verified badge screenshot:

```text
TODO: attach a screenshot of the Verified badge from GitHub or GitLab after pushing feature/lab1.
```

### Why Signed Commits Matter

Signed commits give reviewers cryptographic evidence that a commit was created by the holder of a trusted key, which makes impersonation and silent history tampering easier to detect. The xz-utils backdoor disclosed in March 2024 showed how much damage can come from compromised trust in a software supply chain; signing is not a complete defense by itself, but it strengthens the audit trail and makes suspicious provenance stand out earlier during review.

## Task 2: Pull Request Template and First PR

Added the GitHub pull request template at:

```text
.github/pull_request_template.md
```

Template contents:

```markdown
## Goal
<!-- What does this PR accomplish? 1 sentence. -->

## Changes
- 

## Testing
<!-- How did you verify it? -->

## Checklist
- [ ] Title is a clear sentence (<= 70 chars)
- [ ] Commits are signed (`git log --show-signature`)
- [ ] `submissions/labN.md` updated
```

PR evidence:

```text
TODO: after pushing, open the PR from whynotgm:feature/lab1 to inno-devops-labs:main and attach/link evidence that the PR description auto-populated from the template.
```

## Task 3: GitHub Community

Required actions:

- Starred `inno-devops-labs/DevOps-Intro`: TODO
- Starred `simple-container-com/api`: TODO
- Followed `Cre-eD`: TODO
- Followed `Naghme98`: TODO
- Followed `pierrepicaud`: TODO
- Followed at least 3 classmates: TODO

Stars matter in open source because they help developers bookmark useful projects and give maintainers a visible signal that the project is valuable to the community. Following developers helps teams notice each other's work, discover related projects, and build professional connections that are useful beyond a single course assignment.

## Bonus Task: Branch Protection

Bonus was not completed from the local shell because it requires GitHub or GitLab repository settings and a remote push rejection screenshot.

To complete it later:

```text
1. Enable signed commits, pull requests before merging, and linear history on main.
2. Try an unsigned push to main.
3. Paste the exact remote rejection line here.
4. Attach a screenshot of the branch protection rule page.
```

Reflection:

If Knight Capital had required protected deployment branches, signed commits, pull requests, and linear history for production changes, it would have been harder for unreviewed or inconsistent code to reach production. Required signing would have improved accountability by tying deployable commits to trusted keys. Pull request gates would also have created a visible checkpoint for reviewers to catch incomplete rollout assumptions before they affected live trading systems. These controls do not replace testing or deployment automation, but they reduce the chance that one unchecked change becomes a production incident.
